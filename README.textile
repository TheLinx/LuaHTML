h2. Example LHTML page

<pre>
[[ -- this marks the beginning of a Lua code block
pageTitle = "My Awesome Site!"
announcement = [[
<p>Lua is super awesome!</p>
]]
-- and now we close the block:
]]<html>
<head>
<title>[[=pageTitle]]</title>
<!-- This is valid syntax, "=" is shorthand for "return " -->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Example!</h1>
[[ for x=1,10 do
	print("<p>This is paragraph #"..x.."! I bet you didn't know that!</p>")
end ]]
[[=announcement]]
</body>
</html>
</pre>

h2. Example code

<pre>
-- we assume that 's' is the variable containing the lhtml source
require("luahtml")
output = luahtml.format(s)
-- super simple!!
</pre>
